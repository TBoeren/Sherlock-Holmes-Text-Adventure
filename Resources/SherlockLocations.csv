Inhabitant;Location;Information
Sherlock Holmes (Consulting Detective);42NW;“Come now Wiggins, you can solve this case on your own"
Lomax (Librarian);5SW;"Sorry Wiggins I don't think I can be of much help to you"
Central Carriage Depot;5WC;"Sorry Wiggins I don't think I can be of much help to you"
Sir Jasper Meeks (Medical Examiner);38EC;"Sorry Wiggins I don't think I can be of much help to you"
Langdale Pike (Social Columnist);2SW;"Pike receives us in the visitors sitting-room: “Oppenheimer was already politically compromised, but this recent affair may very well put an end to his career, if proofs are the slightest bit credible. And we are talking about the Times, not a vulgar rag."
Lestrade (Scotland Yard);13SW;Lestrade threatens to kick us out by force when we tell him the reason of our visit.
Henry Ellis (Reporter for The Times);30EC;Henry Ellis accepts to see us despite his seemingly busy schedule: “We just set the cat among the pigeons with the article on Oppenheimer, that we included at the very last moment. Parker played it smart. He and the chief editor seem rather sure of their sources. Otherwise, they wouldn't have published the article."@“We are investigating the disappearance of a German Spitz in Hyde Park and we would like to know..."@“I think that apart from advising you to make an announcement in the Times, I cannot be of any help to you," Ellis cuts off, obviously uninterested.
Disraeli O'Brain;17WC;We review the Somerset House logbooks: Yvonne Nance, nee Parker: married to Robert Nance on August 17, 1857 (Robert Nance, deceased on December 13, 1885) no child, only one brother him too deceased, no will on record.
H.R. Murray (Criminologist);22SW;“Sorry Wauggins I don't think I can be of much help to you"
Porky Shinwell (Owner of the Raven and Rat Pub);52EC;The owner of the Raven & Rat, Porky Shinwell, seems amused by our questions: “So, now you're reduced to looking for a pooch? I hope he didn't bite a bad guy, because in such a case: a good bag and off to the bottom of the Thames!"
Oscar Teevan;16NW;No one has returned Oscar Teevan's dog as of yet.
Mrs Nance;32NW;Mrs Nance invites us in her sitting-room. We notice a wicker basket and a blanket in a corner of the room, close to the front door. “Did you find Charly?" She slumps in an armchair, fixing then a picture of her dog, carrying a ball in his mouth. “This is my sole souvenir of him now," she states sadly. “I haven't been able to lay my hands on his favourite ball for a week, and now, he's the one who disappeared…"@“And did your nephew find anything?"@“Howie? No, but I think his mind is set on other things. He comes to see me every Thursday, but last Thursday, he got here very late and was restless. He didn't want to tell me what was bothering him. Do you think he's in some kind of trouble?" she asks us, concerned.
George Flowers;50NW;The young florist is not insensitive to Wiggins' charm and helps us gladly: “If you're talking about the enigmatic gentleman, he told me he had to buy violets to be forgiven for his mischievousness!"
Baker Meat;53NW;The meat dealer looks at us: “You don't look like you wanna buy anything so, shoo!"
Circus Hengler;56NW;One of the contortionists remembers seeing on Tuesday a rushing young man, followed by a German Spitz. The dog seemed to be in a playful mood, hopping around the man holding something in his hand.
Chinese Wonders;57NW;The waiter does not seem to understand our questions: “Yes, yes, dog very good! A little too much noisy! Very, very nice lady!"
Grosvenor;70NW;A red-faced man welcomes us into his butcher shop. He prepares before us a terrine, meticulously grinding a game's meat, whose origin we can hardly identify: “Ah! You're here for the old bag's pooch? Saw nothing, heard nothing, but I won't complain. I thought I was coming to a quiet neighbourhood, and not a night went by without the dog barking at every passer-by. It was hell! I tolerated it because the lady came to take her regular lot of kidneys for her ‘precious'. Not easy to sell them, and only on a per order basis. He was probably better pampered than Queen Victoria's dog himself. This world is crazy, trust me."
Hyde Park;96NW;As we search the bushes, we see, in the mud, the traces of dog's paws joined seemingly by those of a man, and leaving in the same direction, due east. We find an abandoned string a little farther on.
Parliament;16SW;There is no one in the Parliament who wants to comment on the Oppenheimer affair.
Patrick Hennessy;37WC;Patrick Hennessy does not know Mrs Nance and does not understand one word of our questions, nor why we came to see him
Stuart Oppenheimer;76WC;“No comment on this case," is the sole response we obtain at the parliamentarian's home.
Howard Parker;68EC;We follow Cannon Street up to number 68 and knock at the door of Howard Parker's flat, on the third floor. A young man, looking sleepy, receives us in the corridor, shutting the door behind him. A tad surprised by our investigation, he quickly shortens the conversation: “For the time being, I haven't heard anything about Charly, but I'm not particularly worried. Every dog has his day! My aunt worries way too much and I've better things to do. And so do you, don't you?"
Cannon;69EC;When we ask him if, by chance, he received unusual orders recently, the butcher of Cannon Street answers that a new client specifically requested offal last week and was to pick them up on Tuesday
